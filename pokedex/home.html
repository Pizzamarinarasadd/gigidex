            In this project, you'll find a simple interface where you can search for Pokemon and view detailed information about each one. <br> The data is fetched from an API, which provides information like the Pokemon's name, type, abilities, and an image. <br>
            
            I used HTML to structure the webpage, CSS to style it and make it visually appealing, and JavaScript to handle the data fetching and dynamic content updates. This project not only helped me understand how to work with APIs but also how to create a seamless user experience. <br>
            
            I hope you enjoy exploring my Pokedex as much as I enjoyed building it!
